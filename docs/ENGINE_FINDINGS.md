# BeamNG engine findings (measured)

Facts measured in game while developing Deep Mud (BeamNG.drive 0.40, gridmap_v2 / johnson_valley).
They explain most design decisions; please extend this file when you measure something new.

## ProceduralMesh

- `createMesh` CPU cost: ~0.19 ms per call (burst) / ~0.35 ms (steady, once per frame), plus
  ~0.18 µs per face corner and ~0.38 µs per vertex. Face corners dominate (6 per grid cell).
- Every frame that first draws a freshly uploaded mesh costs ~1 ms in `RenderShadows`
  (+0.2 ms `RenderReflections`), independent of mesh size (4…40 cells) and of the material's
  `castShadows`. Hidden or out-of-view uploads cost ~0. Several uploads in one frame partly add up.
- Showing, hiding and moving existing meshes is free. Delaying the show of an uploaded mesh does not
  avoid the cost.
- No effect on that cost: `collisionType 'None'` (only a dynamic field), `hideInRenderView(63)`
  (reflection view), `ClusterShading.shadowMaxCasters = 0` (local-light shadows).
- Engine memory grows per upload with the variety of submesh sizes: pad submeshes to a few size classes.
- Malformed face tables (corners without `n`/`u`) crash the game in C++. Never test that live.
- A submesh with more than 65535 face corners hangs the game (16-bit counter).
- Collision of a ProceduralMesh only enters physics on `be:reloadCollision()` (~370 ms on gridmap_v2).

## Terrain

- `tb:setHeightGrid` + `tb:updateGrid` take effect for physics at once; `updateGrid` costs 1–2.5 ms
  whatever the box size: merge all writes of a frame into one call.
- Creating a second `TerrainBlock` at runtime and calling its `update*` methods crashed the game.
- `digSdf`/`placeSdf` is an experimental forward-lit SDF renderer, not usable for mud.

## Decal roads

- `DecalRoad.overObjects` drapes by a physics raycast onto collision meshes, not render meshes.
- `zBias` is a depth bias, not a vertical lift.
- With the terrain left at the mud surface (terrain-first) the engine draws decal roads exactly as vanilla.

## Other

- `DynamicShapeBatch` instances shape files (per-instance transforms only).
- `SurfaceMaskClipmap` only feeds the grass (foliage) shader.
- Material changes need `mat:flush()` (~0.4–0.8 ms); `setField` alone does nothing.
- Base-colour alpha is ignored by alpha clip: use `opacityMap`.
- Vehicle tyre material swaps at runtime render chrome.
- Vehicles spawned from Lua start in `realistic` gearbox mode (stay in neutral):
  `controller.mainController.setGearboxMode('arcade')`.
